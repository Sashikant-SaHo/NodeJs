			*** Introduction to NodeJS ***

	- NodeJS is the server side scripting language.

	- NodeJS Used to develop the both Http & TCP Servers.

	- We Can Develop Node Applications by using JavaScript.

	- Node Applications are Single Threaded Applications.

	- Node Supports the Modules (Predefined Modules & Custom Modules)


Modules in NodeJS
-----------------
1) http
	- this module is the native module.

	- this module available along with the node engine.
	
	- this module used to develop the http servers.



2) url
	- this module also native module.

	- this module used to read the get parameters in http servers.



3) querystring

	- this module also native module.

	- this module used to read the post parameters in http servers.


4) fs

	- fs stands for file system.

	- fs module used to interact with the flat files.

		Ex.
			Text Files
			
			XML Files

			JSON Files

5) express

	- this module is the 3rd party module.

	- this module used to develop the Rest API'S (WebServices).


[Note : providing the communication between different technologies called as
	webservices.]


6) mysql
	- this module used to interact with the mysql database.



7) mongodb
	- this module used to interact with the mongodb without schema
	
[Note : rules & regulations of db called as schema]

10) multer
	- this module used to upload the images to the server.


11) socket.io

12) jwt-simple
	- this module used to generate the tokens.

	- generally we will use tokens for authentication purpose.

	- this system technically called as Token Based Authentication System.


13) body-parser

	- this module used to set the MIME Type in ExpressJS.
		Ex.
			Text
			XML
			JSON
			 --
			 --
			 --


14) cluster

	- this module used to implement the child processes in http Server.

	- implementing the child processes also called as load balancing.



15) express-cluster

	- this module used to implement the load balancing in Rest API'S



16) cookie-parser

	- this module used to work with the cookies.



  - we can download all the 3rd party node modules by using either "npm" or
    "yarn" tool.

  - "npm" stands for node packaging manager.

  - "npm" is the integrated tool of node js.

  - yarn is the latest tool, used to download the node modules in fatser manner  
    compared to "npm".

  - all the node modules will be downloads to "node_modules" folder in current path.
	
  - we can start the node server in 3 ways.

	> node server

	> npm start

	> nodemon server (starting the server in watch mode)
